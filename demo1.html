<h3> poem </h3>
<pre> Walking through a field with my little brother Seth

I pointed to a place where kids had made angels in the snow.
For some reason, <b>I </b>told him that a troop of angels
had been shot and dissolved when they hit the ground.

He asked who had <strong>shot</strong> them and I said a farmer.
